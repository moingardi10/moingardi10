ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Moin!

ABOUT ME
Iâ€™m a 2nd-year diploma student who loves exploring the world of programming and tech. 
Right now, Iâ€™m leveling up my skills in:
C, C++, HTML, CSS, and just starting to dive into Java.
Building static and dynamic websites.
Creating text-based adventure games (yes, I made one!).
Working with SQLâ€”got a good grip on it thanks to my Database Management Systems course in the 3rd semester.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me:
Playing games (always up for a challenge!).
Building cool stuff with cardboard (yeah, I enjoy crafting).
Playing outdoor games and keeping active.

Goals
One day, I want to become a software developer or maybe dive into AIâ€”still figuring things out, but itâ€™s all exciting!

What Iâ€™m Working On
Right now, Iâ€™m:
Exploring Java and trying to build something fun with it.
Thinking about my next projectâ€”something creative and useful.

Feel free to check out my repos! Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration. Letâ€™s build something cool together!
